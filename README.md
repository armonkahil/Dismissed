The creators for Project 3 "Dismissed" were Kimberlyn Creary, Joel Margosian, Armon Roberts and Matt Wilson.

The purpose of "Dismissed" is to give schools a more efficient way to move through the carpool process.  We used one school in particular as a case for our app.  The Harmony School in Houston, TX has over 1800 students and they don't use any forms of mass transportation.  Right now they have an archaic pick-up proccess that leads to traffic back-ups for miles and long wait times.

We have created a database with all of the students and parents/guardians.  Each student is linked with all of the guardians who have access to pick them up, other siblings that might ride home with them, the grade they are in, and a family id associated with that family.  There will also be an administrative side to the app that allows school administrators access to the features.  Once a parent/guardian logs into the app the GPS will then check to see when the user gets within a half mile of the pick-up zone.  When they get within a half mile of the pick-up zone a button will appear to give them the option to check in for carpool pick-up.  Once a parent checks in, an alert will be sent to the administrator waiting with the students.  All of the students linked to family account will appear on the administrators screen and they can begin to line the students up for dismissal.

Technologies used for "Dismissed" are JavaScript, Socket IO, Google Maps API, Bcrypt, ReactJS, Bootstrap, Passport, MongoDB, Morgan.Path, ESlint, DOTENV, Axios, React Geolocated, Heroku, Postman, Body Parser, Express, Cors, Mongoose,JSON web token, Validator, Redux-Thunk, React-Router-DOM, Gravatar, Classnames, Proptypes, MERN, and Node.
